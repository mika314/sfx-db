This session focused on refactoring the application to achieve a single-window mode and persist window state.

**Summary of Actions:**

*   **Baseline Establishment:** Reverted `main.cpp` and `imgui-impl-sdl.cpp` to a known good state to ensure a clean starting point.
*   **Single-Window Implementation:**
    *   Disabled ImGui's multi-viewport feature by setting `io.ConfigFlags &= ~ImGuiConfigFlags_ViewportsEnable;` in `main.cpp`.
    *   Created a main ImGui window (`ImGui::Begin("MainUI", ...)`) that fills the entire OS window, removing decorations like title bars, to contain all UI elements.
    *   Removed the separate `ImGui::Begin("Sound Samples")` call, integrating its content into the main UI.
*   **Window State Persistence:** The application uses a custom window state saving mechanism via `window_state.txt`, and `io.IniFilename = "imgui.ini";` was removed from `main.cpp` to prevent ImGui from managing its own `imgui.ini` file for window layouts.
*   **File Management:** Untracked screenshot files were deleted.
*   **Compilation and Execution:** The application was compiled using `coddle` and then run in the background for testing.

**Unusual/Specific Workflow Details:**

*   **`coddle` Build Tool:** The project utilizes `coddle` for compilation, which is a C++ build tool that typically requires no command-line arguments and is simply invoked as `coddle`.
*   **Custom Window State:** The application implements its own window size and position persistence by reading/writing to `window_state.txt`, rather than relying on ImGui's default `imgui.ini` file.
*   **Git Commit Message Constraint:** A specific constraint was encountered where backticks (`) are disallowed in `git commit -m` messages for security reasons, requiring careful formatting of the commit message to avoid them.

This session focused on further refactoring the UI code into a dedicated class.

**Summary of Actions:**

*   **UI Class Creation:** Created `Ui.h` and `Ui.cpp` to encapsulate UI-related logic.
*   **Code Relocation:**
    *   Moved UI-specific code from `main.cpp` into the `Ui::render()` method.
    *   Moved `ImGui` initialization code from `Ui::init()` into the `Ui` class constructor.
    *   Moved `ImGui` shutdown code from `Ui::shutdown()` into the `Ui` class destructor.
*   **Main Function Simplification:** Updated `main.cpp` to instantiate and use the `Ui` class, removing direct `ImGui` calls and `init`/`shutdown` calls.
*   **Verification:** Successfully built the project after each refactoring step using `coddle debug` to ensure correctness.
