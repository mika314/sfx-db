This session focused on refactoring the application to achieve a single-window mode and persist window state.

**Summary of Actions:**

*   **Baseline Establishment:** Reverted `main.cpp` and `imgui-impl-sdl.cpp` to a known good state to ensure a clean starting point.
*   **Single-Window Implementation:**
    *   Disabled ImGui's multi-viewport feature by setting `io.ConfigFlags &= ~ImGuiConfigFlags_ViewportsEnable;` in `main.cpp`.
    *   Created a main ImGui window (`ImGui::Begin("MainUI", ...)`) that fills the entire OS window, removing decorations like title bars, to contain all UI elements.
    *   Removed the separate `ImGui::Begin("Sound Samples")` call, integrating its content into the main UI.
*   **Window State Persistence:** The application uses a custom window state saving mechanism via `window_state.txt`, and `io.IniFilename = "imgui.ini";` was removed from `main.cpp` to prevent ImGui from managing its own `imgui.ini` file for window layouts.
*   **File Management:** Untracked screenshot files were deleted.
*   **Compilation and Execution:** The application was compiled using `coddle` and then run in the background for testing.

**Unusual/Specific Workflow Details:**

*   **`coddle` Build Tool:** The project utilizes `coddle` for compilation, which is a C++ build tool that typically requires no command-line arguments and is simply invoked as `coddle`.
*   **Custom Window State:** The application implements its own window size and position persistence by reading/writing to `window_state.txt`, rather than relying on ImGui's default `imgui.ini` file.
*   **Git Commit Message Constraint:** A specific constraint was encountered where backticks (`) are disallowed in `git commit -m` messages for security reasons, requiring careful formatting of the commit message to avoid them.

This session focused on further refactoring the UI code into a dedicated class.

**Summary of Actions:**

*   **UI Class Creation:** Created `Ui.h` and `Ui.cpp` to encapsulate UI-related logic.
*   **Code Relocation:**
    *   Moved UI-specific code from `main.cpp` into the `Ui::render()` method.
    *   Moved `ImGui` initialization code from `Ui::init()` into the `Ui` class constructor.
    *   Moved `ImGui` shutdown code from `Ui::shutdown()` into the `Ui` class destructor.
*   **Main Function Simplification:** Updated `main.cpp` to instantiate and use the `Ui` class, removing direct `ImGui` calls and `init`/`shutdown` calls.
*   **Verification:** Successfully built the project after each refactoring step using `coddle debug` to ensure correctness.

This session focused on refactoring global audio variables into a dedicated class.

**Summary of Actions:**

*   **AudioPlayerManager Class Creation:** Created `AudioPlayerManager` class to encapsulate audio buffer queues and mutex.
*   **Code Relocation:**
    *   Moved global `audio_buffer_queue`, `audio_buffer_size_queue`, and `audio_mutex` into `AudioPlayerManager` as private members.
    *   Moved `audio_callback` into `AudioPlayerManager` as a non-static member function.
    *   Created `push_buffer` and `clear_buffers` public methods in `AudioPlayerManager` to manage audio data.
*   **Main Function Update:** Updated `main.cpp` to instantiate `AudioPlayerManager` and pass its instance to the `sdl::Audio` constructor and `Ui` class. The lambda for the audio callback now captures the `AudioPlayerManager` instance and calls its non-static `audio_callback` method.
*   **play_audio_sample Update:** Modified `play_audio_sample` to use the `AudioPlayerManager` instance for managing audio buffers.
*   **Verification:** Successfully built the project using `coddle debug` to ensure correctness.

This session focused on moving the `play_audio_sample` function into the `AudioPlayerManager` class.

**Summary of Actions:**

*   **Move `play_audio_sample`:** Moved the `play_audio_sample` function from `audio_decoder.cpp` to `audio_player.cpp` and made it a member function of `AudioPlayerManager`.
*   **Update `Ui.cpp`:** Modified `Ui.cpp` to call the `play_audio_sample` method through the `m_audio_player_manager` instance.
*   **Remove `play_audio_sample` declaration:** Removed the `play_audio_sample` declaration from `audio_decoder.h`.
*   **Verification:** Built the project to ensure correctness.

### Git Commit Message Technique

For complex or detailed commits, the commit message can be written in a separate file. The `git commit -F <file>` command is then used to pass the file's content as the commit message. This allows for easier editing and review of long commit messages.

This session focused on refactoring the metadata extraction logic in the UI.

**Summary of Actions:**

*   **Refactor Metadata Extraction:** Moved the logic for extracting audio file metadata and inserting it into the database from the main `Ui::render` loop into a new private helper function, `Ui::extract_metadata_and_insert`.
*   **Code Organization:** This change improves code organization and readability by separating the file dialog interaction from the metadata processing logic.
*   **Verification:** Successfully built the project using `coddle debug` to ensure the refactoring was correct.
