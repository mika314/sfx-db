This session focused on implementing automatic audio playback upon sample selection.

**Summary of Actions:**

*   **Auto-play on Selection:** Modified `Ui.cpp` to call `m_audio_player_manager.play_audio_sample` immediately when a sample is selected in the ImGui table.
*   **Verification:** Successfully built the project using `coddle debug` to ensure the change was correct.
